## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Nicholas Micallef

I'm a Backend Developer with extensive experience in the logistics industry, specializing in creating robust and scalable backend systems. My technical expertise spans a variety of technologies, with a strong focus on Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, and MongoDB.

In my current role, I have the privilege of leading a team of 16 skilled backend specialists, where we drive innovation and deliver high-quality solutions. I've successfully implemented a scalable architecture capable of handling high volumes, enhancing both performance and reliability across the board.

My skills extend beyond my core stack to include several other database technologies like SQL, PostgreSQL, and Snowflake. I'm also proficient in advanced caching and messaging solutions, such as Redis, RabbitMQ, and Kafka, which help me build efficient, high-performance systems.

Driven by a passion for continuous learning and improvement, I thrive in dynamic environments and enjoy contributing to innovative projects with exceptional results.
